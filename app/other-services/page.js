            A frequently asked question is whether or not JDM can recoup “drawback,” or duty already paid to Customs for exported cargo. The answer is “whenever possible!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Our staff is well aware that this is an important consideration for many importers/exporters, which is why we specialize in duty refunds for goods that have been marked for export following a period within the U.S. commerce system. If your business needs include drawback claims for manufactured, rejected, or unused merchandise, the need for accelerated drawback payment, waiver of prior notice of intent to export, or one-time waiver of prior notice of intent to export, JDM’s team will bring their expertise to bear on the issue and generate the best possible results.

            Although JDM does everything in our power to minimize the possibility of damage or loss of cargo in transit, the chance of an impossible-to-foresee disaster can never be completely removed.

            We encourage our customers to open a Cargo Policy as a way to protect their precious cargo from catastrophic loss. Our rates are competitive and, in the event of a claim, we will work with a government-approved company for settlement. Even the best-laid plans can still go awry.
